# Election-Analysis
Looking at voter data to understand how candidates did and who won. 

## Project Overview 
Working with the Colorado Board of Elections, I am working on the following tasks to complete an election audot of a recent local congressional election. The following is what this analysis goes over:

1. Total number of votes casted
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Total number of votes each candidate received
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resouces
