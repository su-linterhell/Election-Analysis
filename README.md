# Election-Analysis
Looking at voter data to understand how candidates did and who won. 

## Overview of Election Audit  
Working with the Colorado Board of Elections, I am working on the following tasks to complete an election audot of a recent local congressional election. The following is what this analysis goes over:

1. Total number of votes casted
2. Complete list of counties where votes were casted
3. Total number of votes casted in each county
4. Percentage of votes that were casted in each county 
5. Largest County Turnout
6. A complete list of candidates who received votes
7. Total number of votes each candidate received
8. Percentage of votes each candidate won
9. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Summary
This script was originally built to understand the election results for each candidate. It provided clear and concise information on how the election went in regards to the election candidates. Diving deeper, this script was easy to build and repeat for another useful metric, understanding voting turn out in each county. If we had more voter information this script could be replicated pretty simply to dive deeper into characteristics behind the voters. These characteristics may include gender, race, political party and age. Understanding metrics for defining characteristics such as these provides trends on what types of people typically vote for each candidate. Understanding these trends would be very useful for following elections to either target certain groups to increase voter turn out, or for candidates to target groups they may not have as many voters in.
